        <p className="col-lg-5 offset-lg-7 about-parragraph">I always like to maintain healthy relationships in my work environments creating strategies to solve problems and positively analyzing my and my co-workers labor performance.</p> 
        <p className="col-lg-5 offset-lg-7 about-parragraph">What I love the most about being a developer is showing off my creativity, being able to materialize ideas and sharing my knowledge.</p> 
        <p className="col-lg-5 offset-lg-7 about-parragraph">My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe and my music taste goes from Los √Ångeles Azules to Radiohead, but right now my favorite band is Glass Animals. I love mexican and japanese food; my favorite dish are enchiladas de mole and my best friends call me Sashimi. </p>
